# YouTube!

> Edit January, 2022: I still commit code to this repo however, a lot of my newer videos have code in their own repo. This repo link can be found in the description of the respective video.

This repo contains all of the code from my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/benjamincarlson).

The code is organized by month. Ex: if the video was uploaded in June, 2020, the code for that video will be in the June 2020 folder (6-2020). Code is NOT organized by language, project type, etc. By organizing the code by month it should be easy to find the code for the video you are watching. 

Each month has its own table of contents (the README.md file in that month's folder) with the name of each video and a link to that video. The code will be in the folder with the same or similar name as the video. 

## Usage

Below I will write how you should go about using the code based on the framework and language of the project. 

### Python

Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv env`
Activate the environment with `source env/bin/activate`
`cd` into the project and then run `python3 x` where x is the name of the python file

### Flutter + Dart

`cd` into the where main.dart is and run `flutter run`
Make sure a simulator is running or you are connected to an actual device
Run `flutter doctor` if you have issues

### HTML/CSS website

Simply open the project in VSCode, right click, and click open live server.
